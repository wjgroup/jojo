# Does Australia still need 5c coins

### I think not. These are my reasons why:

* To start with, 5c coins are heavy. For example, if you want to buy something that cost $1 dollar are you only have 5c coins, then you will need 20 5c coins, that is a lot of coins. If you add they together it is 2 and half centermeters high. I have an example that I am going to show you later~~, and I am going to spend in the canteen~~
