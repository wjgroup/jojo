# Does Australia still need 5c coins

### I think not. These are my reasons why:

* To start with, lots of 5c coins together are heavy. For example, if you want to buy something that cost $1 dollar are you only have 5c coins, then you will need 20 5c coins, that is a lot of coins. If you add they together it is 2 and half centermeters high. I have an example that I am going to show you later ~~, and I am going to spend in the canteen~~
* Furthermore, 5c coins are small, if you have 5c coins in your pocket and you want to spend it you might loss it because it is so tiny, so it will slip or fall out of your pocket.
* Thrid of all, it is very hard to count if you pay someone with lots of 5c coins. So you waste the other people's time and it may not come out the right amount.
* Finally, you can't really buy anything with just one 5c coin, because it doesn't worth very much. Even the cheapest rubber is going to cost you more than 5 cents.

These are my 4 reasons why.
