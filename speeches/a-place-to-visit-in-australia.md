# A place to visit in Australia

### My place to visit in Australia is Gold Coast.

### I choose Gold Coast because

#### Gold coast has lots of fun places, like Sea World, Movie World and beautiful and super long beaches

#### In Sea world there are
* Sky Fortress with bridges and tunnels made by ropes in the sky
* Seal show and Dolphin show
* Water playground
* Monorail (my little brother loves monorail so much)
* Polar bear (always on asleep) and penguin
* Small roller coaster for kids, and parents
