# Should people climb Uluru

### My answer is **NO**, because it is disrespectful to aboriginal people

Did you know thousands of tiny rocks fell down of Uluru everyday because people were stepping and climing on it, by now it would be smaller than the Uluru we see todaty if goverment didn't ban climbing it.
