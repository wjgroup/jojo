# Should people climb Uluru

### My answer is **NO**, and these are my reasons why we must not climb Uluru:

* It is disrespectful to aboriginal people
* It is steep, desert is hot and windy, it is not a good hiking place for all people. Many people died on it, most were caused by heart attack.
* There were many accidents too, a 12 year girl fell 20 meters on Uluru in 2019, and in 2016 3 people were trapped in a steep crevice and had to ask helicopter to rescue them
* There is no toilet or rubbish bin on Uluru, so people just left all kinds of waste on it and pollute the environment 
* Years and years of footprints have permanently scarred Uluru, did you know thousands of tiny rocks fell down of Uluru everyday because people were stepping and climbing on it, by now it would be smaller than the Uluru we see today if government didn't ban climbing it.
