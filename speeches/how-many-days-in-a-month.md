# How many days in a month

### Have you ever wondered how many days in a particular month, and you don't have a calendar to check?

Well, I have a way to remember it.

To start with, first you call the months a number instead of their actually names, then it will be easier to remember. For example, Jan is 1, Feb is 2, March is 3 Apr is 4, all the way to Dec, the 12th month of the year.

Now let's start from all the months with 31 days, months 1, 3 ,5 ,7 all odd numbers, they have 31 days. 



Then you switch to even numbers, starts from Augest (8), Oct (10) and Dec (12). Then there is Feb. Then rest of the months are having 30 days.
