# How many days in a month

### Have you ever wondered how many days in a particular month, and you don't have a calendar to check?

Well, I have a way to remember it.

To start with, we all know there are 12 months in a year. There are 4 months that having 30 days, 7 months that having 31 days and 1 special month that having only 28 days normally. So 4 plus 7 plus 1 equals 12.

First let's talk about the special month that having 28 days, February. Feb normally has only 28 days, but in every 4 years Feb will have 29 days, which we call it a Leep year. This year, 2020, is a leap year, so Feb has 29 days. And next time when Feb has 29 days is year 2024.

Now let's remember the 4 months that having 30 days, and they are April, June, September and November.

Then, rest of the 7 months all have 31 days. For example, if someone ask you how many days there are in October, since October is no Feb, Apr, June, Sep or Nov, it must have 31 days.

***You no need remember this , all the months that having 31 days are Jan, March, May, July, Augest, October, December.***

Thank you.
